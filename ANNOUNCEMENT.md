Lang Party Summer 2022
===

**Write a language with Racket this summer! Win prizes!**


### Ground Rules

Any language counts as long as you helped to make it. Big or small, brand new
or recently improved.

Submit as many times as you like.

Limit 1 prize per participant. Prizes TBD.

Open until October 1.

Everyone is welcome. Be good. Follow the Racket Friendly Environment Policy:

### How to Submit

Submissions are accepted in any forum where Racket discussions happen.
Announce your language, make sure Ben and/or Stephen see it, and you're in.

The easiest way to make an announcement is to post an issue to the repo for
this event:
